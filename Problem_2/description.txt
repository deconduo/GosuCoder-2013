Hatched Drawings
When making a technical drawing on paper, one of the most laborious tasks is filling in (or using more correct terminology, “hatching”) the interior surfaces of the drawn elements with a line pattern. The most common pattern, used to denote e.g. elements made of steel, consists of diagonal lines drawn at regular intervals throughout the hatched surface, from South-West to North-East, as marked in blue in the figure below.

Little Jack's Dad is an amateur constructor, and Jack has been tasked with helping him to add hatching to a rather large technical drawing. The drawing in question has the shape of an axis-parallel polygon, i.e., all its sides are North-to-South or West-to-East, lying on lines of the integer grid. The hatching has to include the SW-to-NE diagonal of each square of the grid. Jack is not at all happy about his assignment, and would like to know how many line segments (understood as continuous strokes of the pen) he needs to make to complete his task.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer n, denoting the length of the perimeter of the polygon measured in units of the grid (4<=n<=106). The next line of input contains a sequence of exactly n characters from the set {'N','S','W','E'}, describing the sequence of unit shifts with which one can traverse the entire outline of the polygon, starting from a fixed point on its outline.

Output

Your task is to write a single integer to output, denoting the smallest possible number of line segments Jack has to draw in order to perform the hatching.
